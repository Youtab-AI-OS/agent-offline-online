# Windows pilot UI and native model qualification

This candidate follows the first published Runtime source
`5b4ff500fcff5f34f67cd37432f77680c0cbe1aa` (version 0.19.1, sequence 1).
It is not a claim of clean-PC readiness.

## Changes to qualify

1. Installer light/dark text and progress accents are green; the active stage
   uses the existing Simorgh working SVG with reduced-motion support.
2. Native Youtab recommendations use the current profile's admitted Gateway
   catalog. Unsupported Anthropic Messages models remain rejected. Hosted
   Portal recommendations retain their separate tier behavior.
3. Approval displays the description and complete command in a prominent card.
   The request remains session-bound; Run, Reject, shortcuts and permanent
   approval confirmation retain their existing authority checks.
4. Clarification questions have a larger bordered card and larger controls.
5. CLI hero art depicts the Owner-provided Persepolis double-bull capital as
   terminal Braille, without adding a runtime image dependency.
6. The home wordmark uses the bundled Racing Sans One font. Pinned and Sessions
   headings use pin and desktop icons. Keyboard shortcuts remain available in
   Settings while their titlebar icon is hidden.
7. Approval mode and terminal controls are visible by default. A one-time
   migration updates old pilot visibility preferences; subsequent user choices
   to hide either control persist.
8. About uses the Simorgh logo. Dutch and Persian are available in the existing
   language picker. Persian text reads RTL while shell/menu geometry stays LTR.
   Common controls, navigation, Appearance, About, approval and questions are
   translated; specialist untranslated strings use the existing English fallback.

## Local checks

- Desktop: `npm --prefix apps/desktop run typecheck` and `npm --prefix apps/desktop run build`.
- Installer: `npm --prefix apps/bootstrap-installer run build`.
- Focused Desktop UI tests cover onboarding, approval, clarification, languages,
  runtime readiness and statusbar visibility/persistence.
- Python tests run through `scripts/run_tests.sh --file-retries 0` with isolated
  homes, including native recommendation and profile integration regressions.
- OWASP smoke, SAST, secrets, dependency, router policy, container isolation,
  branding with OCR, compileall, required Ruff and offline lock checks.
- Browser component smoke covers English/Dutch/Persian, actual font loading,
  full-command visibility, no automatic approval and explicit rejection.
- Built installer browser smoke covers progress, success, failure, SVG tint
  and reduced-motion behavior using synthetic native events.

The broad Windows test run is not green. Interrupted local full-suite runs and
worker startup timeouts must be reported separately from focused passing tests.
Require exact-head remote CI before merge; do not waive required protection.
Browser mocks do not prove native inference, native install or real update.

## Real PC update acceptance

After exact-head review and Owner merge/publication authorization:

1. Build from the approved new main SHA and private, verified release base.
2. Publish a new immutable SHA directory and an approved version/sequence above
   the live sequence. Verify downloads before atomically promoting `latest.json`.
   Never overwrite the original release directory or reuse provisional metadata.
3. On the existing PC, preserve the working configuration and chats. Record
   the installed SHA/version/sequence, then use About → Check now → Update now.
4. Verify the update is discovered, installation finishes, the app restarts,
   and installed metadata identifies the new SHA/sequence.
5. Confirm chat/config preservation, native Youtab sign-in followed by a real
   Gateway DeepSeek response, restart persistence, approval denial and each UI
   change. Confirm the working direct-API path still functions.
6. Separately exercise repair and controlled rollback using isolated synthetic
   test data. Do not deliberately damage the Owner's working PC installation.

The packaged customer About update path now downloads and stages the matching
Setup from the approved release before handoff. Qualify both the installed
Runtime/Desktop identity and the stored Setup identity after the update; a
successful Runtime update alone does not prove Setup replacement. Legacy
installations may still require the documented one-time migration with the
common Setup. Do not claim that an older staged Setup has acquired new visuals
or protocol support until the actual installed file is verified.

Mask private release prefixes, credentials, OAuth callback codes/state and
customer data in logs, screenshots and reports. Record actual observations,
including failures; never substitute unit mocks for PC acceptance.


## Priority CLI branding follow-up

The inherited wide glyph banner is removed from the Python CLI and TypeScript TUI.
The replacement reads **Youtab Code** in a compact ASCII design, with a plain title
at narrow widths. The default CLI uses Ocean Blue (`#0096C7`, light accents
`#0077B6`), including its double-bull reference column, input rules and panel
borders. Error and warning colors retain their semantic meanings. Alternate
user-selected skins remain available. Customer installations need the qualified
release update to receive this change; prior immutable artifacts are not edited.

### Preventing the retired banner from returning

The branding CI gate rejects the retired glyph signature in product sources,
including renamed assets. The artifact builder rejects it before publishing any
immutable directory or replacing the latest pointer. Git updates validate the
new tree and use the existing rollback path on rejection; ZIP updates reject it
before copying files into the installation. The pinned install script checks
staged Runtime sources before promotion. Preserved history, evidence and
dependencies are excluded from the source-tree check. The TUI substitutes the
Youtab Code title when a custom skin requests the retired logo.

These protections require the new code and a newly built pinned Setup. Older
installed updaters and Setup executables do not acquire them retroactively.
Qualify the supported legacy transition and real update before declaring PC
acceptance. Never publish an older candidate containing the retired banner.
