/**
 * Which built-in pages disappear when this deployment has no credential

 *
 * Presentation only. The server refuses the underlying routes on its own
 * authority, per the caller's role — see `youtab_agent_cli/authz.py`, and the
 * separation pinned in `tests/youtab_agent_cli/test_authz_separation.py`.
 * Nothing here protects anything; a client that skipped it entirely would be
 * refused exactly the same. What it avoids is a sidebar advertising a page
 * that can only answer 403.
 *
 * `offered` is per-caller, not per-deployment: the same instance shows the
 * Owner these entries and hides them from a customer.
 *
 * These live outside `App.tsx` so the rule can be tested as a pure function
 * rather than by mounting the whole application, which is how the rest of this
 * directory is tested.
