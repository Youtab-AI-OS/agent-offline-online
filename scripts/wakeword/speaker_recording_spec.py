"""Machine-readable specification for the real-human speaker recording round.

``SPEAKER_RECORDING_PACKAGE.md`` tells a speaker what to record and exactly
what to name each file; ``validate_speaker_submission.py`` checks that a
submitted folder actually matches. Both are read off this module
rather than each keeping its own copy of the phrase list, the folder names,
the take counts, the speaker assignments and the metadata fields, for the same
reason ``phrases.py`` gives for being the one place the training and
evaluation phrase inventories live: two copies of a label map drift, and a
drifted copy fails silently rather than loudly.

Nothing here is trained on. It is the checklist a real recording is held to
before it is ever considered for ``build_dataset.py``'s inputs.

The phrase taxonomy
-------------------
``phrases.py`` is the product's wake-phrase contract, and this module does not
get a second opinion about it. Every phrase in the near-phrase battery below
carries a ``contract`` field naming the ``phrases.py`` tuple that decides its
label, and ``tests/tools/test_wakeword_speaker_recording_spec.py`` checks the
claim against the real tuple. Every row is decided by the contract today.
"okay youtab.", "hey google." and "hey siri." were once in neither tuple and
carried their label here, beside the contract rather than in it; an Owner
decision has since put all three into ``phrases.HARD_NEGATIVES``, so they are
read off the contract like every other negative.

``CONTRACT_ABSENT`` and ``TAXONOMY_DECISIONS`` stay as the route for the next
phrase that arrives undecided — empty now, and required to be — because a
phrase may not be absent from ``phrases.py`` and label-free: defaulting is how
"hey you tab." — the wake word's own split-carrier spelling — was once recorded
as if it were a near miss.
