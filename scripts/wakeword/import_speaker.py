"""Ingest one human speaker's recordings, or refuse the whole submission.

Why
---
Round 8 is trained, selected and qualified on real recordings of real people,
and there will be five of them. Every one of those recordings is given once, by
a person who cannot be asked to do it again, and each one arrives as a folder on
a removable drive with no schema, no digest anybody has checked, and a
speaker-facing naming convention that a recorder app is free to ignore.

Between that folder and ``build_human_dataset.py`` there is exactly one step
where a mistake is still cheap: this one. So it is written to refuse rather than
to cope. The failures it exists to prevent are all quiet ones:

**A take nobody can label.** ``SPEAKER_RECORDING_PACKAGE.md`` promises the
speaker that "our loader refuses to guess a label". A file called
``Voice Memo 3.wav`` in ``positive_normal/`` is not a positive with an unknown
take number; it is a recording whose content nobody can state, and a dataset
that guessed would be teaching the model something nobody decided. Every file
under the recording tree is classified, and an unclassified one fails the
import instead of being skipped.

**A speaker in the wrong split.** The role of each label — train, validate,
sealed — was fixed before any of this audio existed, in ``round8_config.json``
and in ``speaker_recording_spec.SPEAKER_ASSIGNMENTS``. It is looked up here from
those two records and checked against each other. It is never inferred from a
path, never read out of the submission, and there is deliberately no
command-line flag that can set it: promoting a sealed voice into training spends
the only measurement nobody has tuned against, and re-recording that speaker
cannot restore it, because they would no longer be unseen.

**The same recording counted twice.** A copied file, a re-submitted folder, or
one take shared between two speakers' folders inflates a count and, across
roles, trains on the audio that is supposed to measure. A SHA-256 does not move
with a file, so the digests of everything already imported — including the two
manifests frozen before this round — are what this checks against.

**"Preserved byte-for-byte" as a claim rather than a fact.** Every original is
hashed on the drive before anything happens, verified again as it is copied,
and re-hashed on both sides *after* the report and the manifest are written. If
any digest moved, nothing is published.

**A record that reads as complete and is not.** An interrupted run leaves a
journal, some verified copies, and no manifest — never a truncated one. The
manifest is produced by ``freeze_manifest.py`` into a staging directory and
moved into place with a single atomic rename, last of everything.

What it does not do
-------------------
It does not decide what a take is worth. Nothing is trimmed, converted,
re-levelled, mixed or relabelled, and no clip is cut: segmentation into clips is
the derivation's job, downstream of a frozen original. The only judgement made
here is whether a file contains recorded sound at all, under the predeclared
rules in ``PREDECLARED_EXCLUSIONS`` — and an excluded take keeps its label, its
bytes and its place in the manifest, exactly as E001's and E002's exclusions did.
Quiet, distant, noisy, fast and clipped takes are reported and kept: those are
the conditions the detector is failing, and a pipeline that dropped them would
be measuring a room nobody records in.

Format facts and level facts are read by different code on purpose. Container,
codec, sample rate, channels and declared duration come from parsing the
container; peak, RMS, DC offset, clipping and the noise floor come from
decoding. A decoder asked for "the sample rate" will happily answer with
whatever it resampled to, and a format report contaminated by a decoder default
cannot be used to show that a recording was never transcoded.

Usage::

    import_speaker.py --speaker E003 --submission DIR --into DIR --dry-run
    import_speaker.py --speaker E003 --submission DIR --into DIR

``--dry-run`` runs every check and writes nothing; it is what the Owner runs
against the drive before anything is copied. ``--into`` is the external data
root: this refuses to read a submission from inside the repository and refuses
to write anything into it, because raw audio and a filled metadata form must
never reach git or CI. Authorization to use the recordings is the project-level
registry fact (membership of ``speaker_recording_spec.SPEAKER_ASSIGNMENTS``),
not a document: no consent scan is required, ingested, copied or hashed here.
