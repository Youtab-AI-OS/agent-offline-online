"""Non-audio, non-GUI logic for the compact recording assistant.

Everything a test can check without a microphone, a speaker or a display lives
here: the plan/section/step model, the automatic filename and directory
assignment, resumable progress that reconciles against the files actually on
disk, per-take quality inspection (empty / too short / clipped / unreadable),
the SHA-256 manifest, the metadata form, and the record/keep/redo/replay
session controller. The controller takes its "speak the prompt" and "capture
the microphone" behaviours as injected callables, so the whole flow -- and the
single most important rule, that a written take contains only the captured
human stream and never the prompt -- is exercised in tests with fakes and no
hardware.

Import-safe with no audio stack present: this module imports only the standard
library, ``numpy`` (already a project dependency) and ``speaker_recording_spec``.
``audio.py`` is where ``sounddevice`` and ``pyttsx3`` are touched, lazily.
