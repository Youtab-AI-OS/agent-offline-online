"""The compact "Hey Youtab" recording plan, as data.

The phrase *set* is single-sourced from ``speaker_recording_spec`` -- this
module reads the canonical positive conditions, the 34-row near-phrase battery
and the two continuous sections off that module and does not keep a second copy
of any phrase. What it owns is the compact *repetition counts*: a short,
guided sitting a volunteer can finish in roughly 12-16 minutes, rather than the
full round's ~65-minute package. Every directory name and filename token still
comes from ``speaker_recording_spec`` so a folder recorded from this plan is
named exactly the way ``validate_speaker_submission.py`` and ``import_speaker.py``
expect -- the counts are smaller, the naming is identical.

``core.py`` turns the section/group data here into concrete recording steps
(one file each) and assigns their filenames and directories. Nothing in this
module touches the filesystem, imports an audio stack, or knows about a GUI.
