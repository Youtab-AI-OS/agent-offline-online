"""Round 8's execution order, as a state machine that cannot be run out of order.

Why this exists
---------------
``ROUND8_DESIGN.md`` fixes an order and calls it non-negotiable: verify the
training manifests, verify the validation manifest, prove the sealed sets are
still sealed, start from nothing, run the three predeclared widths, select on
E005 alone, export both backends from one frozen checkpoint, measure both
through the real product runtime, require 5/5 with zero detection
disagreements, freeze everything, and only then — as a separate, deliberate
act — open a sealed set.

An order written in a document is followed by whoever read it most recently.
Every failure this project has recorded was available in a document at the
time: the threshold retuned on the set it was measured on, the ``0.000/h`` over
11.659 hours printed next to the word "pass", the synthetic warm start behind a
guard that had no caller. So the order is code here, the transitions are
persisted, and a state whose predecessor has not succeeded cannot run at all.

What this file is *not*
-----------------------
It is not a second implementation of anything. Every check it makes either
delegates to the module that owns it or verifies that module's own recorded
output:

============================  =========================================
what                          who owns it
============================  =========================================
the predeclaration            ``round8_config.check``
manifest freshness            ``freeze_manifest.verify``
"this set may not be used     ``freeze_manifest.assert_usable_for``
for that"
which split a speaker is in   ``build_human_dataset.registry_split``
a synthetic initialization    ``build_human_dataset.refuse_synthetic_initialization``
a retired artifact's bytes    ``retired_synthetic_artifacts.json``, via
                              ``qualify.retired_hashes``
whether 5/5 is *demonstrated* ``qualify.build_report``
the freeze's completeness     ``qualify.FreezeRecord.assert_complete``
spending a sealed set         ``qualify.SealLedger.open_sealed``
which files ship, by backend  ``promote_model.BACKEND_ARTIFACTS``
the five acceptance targets   ``promote_model.ACCEPTANCE_TARGETS`` and
                              ``qualify.TARGETS``, cross-checked
============================  =========================================

Because a delegation that is quietly dropped looks exactly like a check that
passed, every state declares the delegates it must call and the controller
refuses the state if one of them was not called. Deleting a line is therefore a
test failure and not a silent weakening.

The expensive stages — training an arm, exporting, streaming a corpus through
the runtime, computing a verdict — are injected callables. That is what makes
this file testable without a GPU, without audio and without a single recorded
human being, and it is also what keeps the orchestrator from growing a second
copy of the training loop.

Two things it deliberately refuses to do
----------------------------------------
**It never computes a verdict.** ``qualify.py`` decides whether the evidence
*demonstrates* a target, and on Round 8's own projected quantities it refuses
targets 2 and 3 for want of evidence (11.66 h against the 15 the 0.2/h target
needs; 112 near-phrase utterances against 150). State 9 reads
``official.qualified_5_of_5`` and the harness's own verdict line and refuses
with them quoted. There is no path here that converts a refusal into a pass,
and no arithmetic here that could produce a competing answer.

**It never promotes.** Shipping is ``promote_model.py``'s gate, with its own
authorization and its own ledger. This controller stops at the freeze.

The barrier between state 10 and state 11
-----------------------------------------
Opening a sealed set publishes the one measurement nobody has tuned against,
and no amount of care puts it back. So state 11 is not in ``SEQUENCE``: the
automatic driver iterates states 1 to 10, ``run_state`` refuses state 11 by
name, ``advance(to=11)`` refuses, and the CLI has no way to spell it. State 11
runs only through :meth:`Round8Controller.open_sealed`, which additionally
requires the exact authorization phrase ``OPEN SEALED <dataset>`` for the one
dataset being spent. Reaching it takes a different command, a different method
and a sentence that names the cost.

Refusals, and what each one is for
---------------------------------
Every refusal below is a distinct failure with a distinct name, so a log line
says what went wrong rather than that something did.

================================  ==================================================
refusal                           the condition it fails closed on
================================  ==================================================
SyntheticInitializationRefused    a synthetic hash, retired checkpoint or the
                                  shipped model offered as initialization
SealedSpeakerLeakRefused          a sealed speaker in training, validation or
                                  selection
ValidationSpeakerLeakRefused      a validation speaker in training
ThresholdMovedAfterSealRefused    the threshold changed after the freeze
BackendMissingRefused             ONNX or TFLite absent
BackendFallbackRefused            a requested backend silently became the other
IncompleteEvidenceRefused         evidence missing what a verdict needs
IncompatibleCheckpointRefused     a resume from a checkpoint that is not this plan's
WeightsDivergedRefused            the two exports did not come from one checkpoint
DetectionDisagreementRefused      a non-zero detection disagreement
QualificationRefused              the harness did not declare 5/5 (this is how an
                                  underpowered target surfaces)
ManifestNotFrozenRefused          a manifest that does not verify against its data
SealAlreadySpentRefused           a sealed set with an opening already on the record
StateOutOfOrderRefused            a state whose predecessor has not succeeded
PlanChangedRefused                the predeclaration moved under a run
DelegationMissingRefused          a state did not call a check it must delegate
SealBarrierRefused                state 11 reached without its own deliberate command
================================  ==================================================

Usage::

    round8_controller.py plan    --journal round8_journal.json
    round8_controller.py status  --journal round8_journal.json
    round8_controller.py advance --journal round8_journal.json --to 3
    round8_controller.py open-sealed --journal round8_journal.json \\
        --dataset E006 --authorize 'OPEN SEALED E006'

``advance`` cannot reach state 11, whatever ``--to`` says.
