"""Fail on retired upstream identity used as Youtab product identity.

This gate used to fail on *any* occurrence of the retired upstream brand
outside ``LICENSE`` and ``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md``. That is the wrong test in
two directions at once:

- it passed a tree that still carried the upstream author's handle and home
  directory, because the pattern never covered contributor identity; and
- it would fail a tree that correctly names a real third-party model id or
  repository, which pressures the next author into rewriting third-party
  facts. That is exactly how the previous pass ended up shipping unroutable
  model ids and a `.mailmap` full of invented addresses.

So the text half of this gate now delegates to
:mod:`scripts.youtab.brand_url_inventory`, which assigns every occurrence to
one of six classes and blocks only the forbidden ones: product identity,
runtime download/update, and anything unclassified.

This module keeps the two checks the classifier cannot do: paths, and binary
assets via OCR.

The OCR half separates two failures that used to be indistinguishable. "No OCR
engine is installed here" is an environment fault: it says nothing about any
particular image, so recording it as one ``UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_FIX_OR_EVIDENCE``
per image buried the real signal under an entry for every shipped asset --
including 16x16 favicons that carry no text at all -- and made an unchecked
tree look exactly like a tree full of retired branding. It is now reported
once, as a gate error. The gate still refuses to pass, so the "never silently
pass" property is unchanged; only the message is honest about which failure
happened.

Exit codes:

- ``0`` -- the gate ran and found nothing blocking.
- ``1`` -- the gate ran and found blocking occurrences.
- ``2`` -- the gate could not run: OCR was requested but no engine exists.
