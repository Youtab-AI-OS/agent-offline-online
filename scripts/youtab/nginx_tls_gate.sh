# Prove the origin's TLS floor against a real nginx, not against a string.
#
# `tests/youtab_runtime/test_origin_protection.py` reads the generated block
# and asserts what it says. That is necessary and it is not sufficient: the
# question this gate answers is whether an nginx built the way the deployment
# target is built actually refuses a TLS 1.0 ClientHello. Nothing about a
# config file guarantees that -- `ssl_protocols` absent was the entire
# exposure, and "absent" reads as innocuous in a diff.
#
# nginx 1.18.0 because that is what the origin runs (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). The
# image is Debian Buster, so its OpenSSL is 1.1.1, which still speaks TLS 1.0
# and TLS 1.1. That matters more here than the nginx version does; see below.
#
#
# Why this gate cannot pass vacuously
# -----------------------------------
# "TLS 1.0 was rejected" is worthless on its own. A modern OpenSSL client
# refuses to *offer* TLS 1.0 no matter what the server would have accepted, so
# the assertion passes against a server that happily serves it. A test that
# cannot fail is not evidence.
#
# So this gate runs two servers from the SAME artifact:
#
#   :443   the committed file, byte for byte
#   :9443  the committed file with `ssl_protocols` mutated to re-enable
#          TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, and nothing else changed
#
# and it asserts, before it asserts anything else, that :9443 NEGOTIATES
# TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 with this client. If it does not, the environment cannot
# observe legacy TLS, every rejection below would be vacuous, and the gate
# fails saying exactly that rather than reporting a pass it did not earn.
#
# That preflight is also the mutation evidence, re-run on every CI run rather
# than performed once by hand: the only difference between the server that
# serves TLS 1.0 and the server that refuses it is the directive this change
# added.
#
# The client's OpenSSL is deliberately relaxed (`MinProtocol = None`,
# `SECLEVEL=0`) so that it will offer legacy protocols. That relaxation lives
# in this container and nowhere else. It can only make the gate harder to
# pass: it removes the client-side and library-side reasons a legacy handshake
# might fail, leaving `ssl_protocols` as the only thing left that can refuse
# it. Production configuration is never weakened to make a test observable.

# is presented, which is worth stating because the obvious test asserts that
# it does -- and that test fails against a correctly configured nginx. nginx
# installs a verify callback that always returns 1 and defers the decision, so
# the handshake completes and the request is refused afterwards with nginx's
# internal 496, served as `400 No required SSL certificate was sent`.
#
# So the refusal is an HTTP status, and the two controls separate cleanly:
#
#   no certificate            -> 400   rejected before the access phase
#   certificate not from the CA -> 400   same
