"""Classify every identity leak by the surface a normal user could reach it on.

``brand_url_inventory`` answers "is this occurrence allowed to exist". That is
a different question from "can a normal user see it", and the second one is the
one the product identity policy is actually about. A provider id in a
server-side binding table is fine. The same string rendered in the Models page,
an error message, a session export or a notification is a leak.

So this tool scans for two token families rather than one:

* the retired upstream brand, which must never be product identity; and
* the private engine binding -- provider ids, engine ids and raw model ids --
  which is server-side truth and must never be public identity.

and assigns every occurrence a *surface* (where it lives) and a *reachability
class* (who can see it):

``USER_REACHABLE``    a normal, non-operator user can see this string in the
                      product: UI text, CLI output, help, errors, prompts,
                      logs shown to users, About/footer, installer output,
                      published docs and images, exports, history,
                      notifications, tool and skill descriptions, URLs, and
                      environment examples users are told to copy.
                      **This class must be zero.**
``LEGAL_PROVENANCE``  licence text, copyright, contributor attribution,
                      third-party notices. Required to exist.
``PRIVATE_BINDING``   server-side mapping between a public profile and the
                      engine that serves it: adapters, registries, routing,
                      credential plumbing. Correct, and must stay private.
``MIGRATION_COMPAT``  a legacy identifier retained only so existing user data,
                      configs or APIs keep working, plus the tests that pin
                      that behaviour. Never rendered as current identity.

Production policy this encodes (Owner decision, 2026-08-02):

* BYOK is **disabled for every normal user**. There is no user-facing provider
  API-key entry, provider catalogue, model identifier or BYOK setup path, and
  the restriction is enforced server-side rather than by hiding controls.
* Users authenticate through Youtab and see **Alpha v0.6** and nothing else.
  The upstream credential and the engine binding behind that profile are
  Youtab-managed and live only in the production secret-management
  environment. Neither is named here: this file is scanned like any other, and
  a policy document that spells out the binding in order to forbid it puts the
  binding on a readable surface. ``agent_identity`` holds the mapping.
* Provider integration code is **kept**, as private backend infrastructure and
  as disabled internal capability for a future entitlement-controlled
  Enterprise/on-premise feature. It is not deleted, and it is not reachable.
* An exact provider identity or engine binding may appear **only** in private
  backend infrastructure, Secret Manager, access-controlled operator records,
  compliance records and processor agreements -- see ``PRIVATE_RECORD_PATHS``.
* Public Terms and Privacy carry only the generic disclosure: that Youtab uses
  carefully selected third-party infrastructure and AI processing providers,
  subject to contractual, confidentiality, security and data-protection
  requirements. They may **not** name a provider, and may **not** associate any
  provider with a named Youtab Agent.
* Nothing anywhere may state or imply that Alpha is, uses or is powered by a
  particular provider. ``ALPHA_BINDING_DISCLOSURE`` detects that claim on its
  own, because it is a leak even where the provider token alone would be one.

Anything a rule cannot place lands in ``USER_REACHABLE``, deliberately: an
unclassified occurrence is treated as a leak until someone evidences otherwise.
That is the same fail-closed posture the branding gate takes for an
uninstallable OCR engine -- not being able to prove something is safe is not
the same as it being safe.

Exit codes:

- ``0`` -- no occurrence is user-reachable.
- ``1`` -- at least one is.
