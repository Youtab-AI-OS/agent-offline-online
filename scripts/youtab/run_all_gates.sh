# `tests/youtab_runtime` alone did not reach the dashboard's own surface, so
# the gateway lifecycle contract — the truthful start/stop/restart result and
# the authorization that guards it — was committed but never executed here.
# A test that CI does not run is documentation.
#
# The whole of `tests/youtab_agent_cli`, not a named subset. The subset was a
# deliberate narrowing while that directory's inherited failures were unowned,
# and it cost real coverage: the authorization flip shipped two rules written
# as fixed-segment patterns against `:path` routes, and both 403'd every real
# request. Nothing in the 19 selected files touched them. `test_web_server.py`,
# `test_plugin_runtime_disable_gate.py` and `test_web_server_gateway_topology.py`
# all caught it immediately.
#
# `run_tests.sh` runs each file in its own subprocess, which is what makes the
# widening viable: the inherited suite's failures were overwhelmingly
# cross-test pollution and disappear under per-file isolation.
# `tests/tools` joins them. It was the largest body of production-relevant
# coverage CI did not run, and that gap was not theoretical: the home-fold
# repair in `tools/approval.py` — without which `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
# never folded to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and every dangerous-command pattern
# anchored on `~/` stopped firing for a root install — is proved by
# `tests/tools/test_approval.py`, which nothing in CI executed. So are the
# file-write safety, browser secret-exfil and yolo-mode suites.
#
# Nothing is deselected. `test_bundled_hey_youtab_model_ships_on_disk` was
# excluded by name while `tools/wakewords/` shipped no model — the rebrand
# renamed the expected filename, but a text rebrand cannot rename a trained
# model, so the binaries were dropped in the transplant and the advertised
# default detector could not load at all. It could not be closed by renaming
# another model in either: an openWakeWord model only detects the phrase it
# was trained on. The model is now genuinely trained (`scripts/wakeword/`),
# both artifacts ship, and the test runs here like every other.
#
# `--file-retries 0` is load-bearing, not tidiness. The runner defaults to one
# automatic re-run of any failing FILE (`_DEFAULT_FILE_RETRIES = 1`): a file
# that fails then passes is counted as passed and reported as FLAKY. That is a
# reasonable default for a developer's local loop, but in the REQUIRED gate it
# means green can be reached on the second attempt — and a test that only
# passes on retry is not genuinely green. Every test here must pass on its
# first execution. Do not remove this flag to quiet an intermittent failure;
# fix the flake at its root cause instead.
