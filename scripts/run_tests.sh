#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Canonical test runner for youtab-agent-runtime. Run this instead of calling
# `pytest` directly to guarantee your local run matches CI behavior.
#
# What this script enforces:
#   * Per-file isolation via scripts/run_tests_parallel.py — each test
#     file runs in its own freshly-spawned `python -m pytest <file>`
#     subprocess. No xdist, no shared workers, no module-level leakage
#     between files.
#   * TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8, PYTHONHASHSEED=0 (deterministic)
#   * Env vars blanked (conftest.py also does this, but this
#     is belt-and-suspenders for anyone running pytest outside our
#     conftest path — e.g. on a single file)
#   * Proper venv activation (probes .venv, venv, then ~/.youtab-agent-runtime/...)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_tests.sh                            # full suite
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -j 4                       # cap parallelism
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/               # discover only here
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/ tests/acp/    # multiple roots
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py               # single file
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -q            # path + bare pytest flag
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -v --tb=long  # bare flags "just work"
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -k 'pattern'               # value flags pass through too
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -- --tb=long  # explicit '--' still works
#
# Bare pytest flags (anything starting with '-' that isn't one of this
# runner's own options: -j/--jobs, --paths, --slice, --file-timeout, etc.)
# are forwarded to each per-file pytest invocation automatically — no '--'
# separator required. The explicit '--' form still works and stacks with
# bare flags. Positional path arguments override the default discovery
# root (tests/).

# breaks architecture qualification and native child cleanup under env -i.
# Dropping the location variables breaks collection on native
# Windows (issues #67385, #70813). These are platform/location variables, not
# credentials, so forwarding them keeps the isolation intent intact. Each is

# gap. Setting the retry knob to 0 ahead of this script silently kept
# `_DEFAULT_FILE_RETRIES = 1`, so a run the operator had labelled
# "file-retries=0" still re-ran failing files and still reported files that

# ── ...and the installed dependencies, for the same reason ──────────────────
# The warm-up above stops at the repo boundary, and the workers do not: the
# first parallel launch has hundreds of subprocesses importing the same
# dependency trees at the same time, and every one of them that finds a
# missing .pyc compiles it and writes it into site-packages.
#
# Whether that window exists at all depends on which installer built the
# environment, which is why this is not redundant with the line above.
# Measured on numpy 2.4.3 into a fresh venv: `pip install` leaves 406 of 406
# .pyc in place before any test runs, `pip install --no-compile` leaves 0 of
# 406 (uv likewise does not byte-compile unless asked for it). So a
# pip-installed CI environment starts warm, while a uv-built or --no-compile
# venv hands the entire dependency tree to the workers to compile
# concurrently. Doing it once here means no worker has to write into
# site-packages at all.
#
# Measured cost, 5981 .py files under site-packages, on a 2-CPU cpuset:
# 3.0s when already compiled (the CI case -- compileall skips up-to-date
# files, so this is a stat walk), 9.1s from completely cold.
#
# purelib+platlib only -- the dependencies, not the stdlib, which every
# interpreter distribution ships pre-compiled.
#
# Strictly best-effort, and quiet about it: a read-only or system-owned
# site-packages, or a dependency shipping .py files whose syntax this
# interpreter rejects, is not a reason for the test suite not to run. `-q -q`
# suppresses the per-error output that would otherwise scroll past, and the
# exit status is discarded on purpose.
