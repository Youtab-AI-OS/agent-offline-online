"""The route authorization registry says what it means, and matches the router.

The registry is data, and data that nobody checks is a document rather than a
control. These tests hold three separate things:

* its own invariants — no duplicate decision, no unknown method, no
  unjustified public entry — enforced at construction so a malformed registry
  cannot be imported at all, let alone serve a request;
* its agreement with the router the application really builds, so an entry for
  a route that no longer exists is caught as staleness rather than read as
  coverage;
* its agreement with ``authz.ROUTE_SCOPES`` wherever both describe the same
  route, because two tables that disagree about one route is worse than either
  table alone.

Coverage is deliberately *not* asserted to be complete here. It is not
complete yet, and a test that pretended otherwise — by asserting a subset, or
by comparing against a frozen list rather than the router — would turn a
partial registry into a green check. The completeness assertion lands with the
default-deny flip, together with the Router-vs-policy gate.
