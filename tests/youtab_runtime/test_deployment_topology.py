"""The deployment topology the dashboard's lifecycle controls actually require.

`service_manager` locates supervised slots under `S6_DYNAMIC_SCANDIR`
(`/run/service`), which is container-local tmpfs. That single fact decides the
topology: a `gateway-default` slot registered inside a gateway container is
invisible to a dashboard running in a *different* container, so the dashboard's
Restart Gateway control fails with `no such gateway 'default'` and the UI
reports "Gateway restart failed with exit 1 / Gateway Status: Off".

That is exactly what shipped. `docker-compose.yml` declared two services, and
nothing in the repository bridges them -- no lifecycle API, no control socket,
no shared supervisor, no authenticated IPC. Mounting the Docker socket would
have made it "work" and would have handed the web application root control of
the host.

These tests pin the contract so the split cannot come back by being tidier.
