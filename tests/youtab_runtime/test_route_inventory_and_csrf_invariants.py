"""The route inventory is real, and the CSRF controls stay where they were put.

Two things, together because the second is the precondition for the first: the
authorization registry that is coming will be checked against this inventory,
and it must not be built on a surface whose existing protections have quietly
regressed.

The inventory reads the router the application actually builds. A
hand-maintained list drifts the moment someone adds an endpoint, and that drift
is exactly what the registry gate will exist to catch -- so the thing being
compared has to come from the framework, not from a file someone remembered to
update.
