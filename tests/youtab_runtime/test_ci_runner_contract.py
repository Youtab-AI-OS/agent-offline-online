"""The required gate must prove a first-execution pass.

Background
----------
``scripts/run_tests_parallel.py`` re-runs a failing test FILE once by default
(``_DEFAULT_FILE_RETRIES = 1``) and counts a pass-on-retry as passed, reporting
it as FLAKY. Useful locally; not acceptable in the required CI gate, where a
test that only passes on the second attempt is not genuinely green.

Two independent defects let a hidden retry survive an operator's attempt to
turn retries off, and each gets a test here:

1. ``scripts/run_tests.sh`` execs the runner under ``env -i`` — an empty
   environment with an explicit opt-in whitelist. Every
   ``YOUTAB_AGENT_TEST_*`` knob the runner documents in its own ``--help``
   was missing from that whitelist, so ``YOUTAB_AGENT_TEST_FILE_RETRIES=0``
   never reached the runner. It fell back to ``1``. A run the operator had
   labelled ``file-retries=0`` still reported files that passed only on the
   retry, because the flag had been eaten by the plumbing.

2. The required gate (``scripts/youtab/run_all_gates.sh``) invoked
   ``run_tests.sh`` without ``--file-retries 0``, so the gate ran with the
   retry default regardless of what any environment variable said.

These are consistency tests over the real files, deliberately written to fail
loudly rather than vacuously: each one first asserts that it actually located
what it set out to parse. An earlier flag-consistency test in this repo passed
for months because its regex matched nothing and ``set() <= set()`` is true.
