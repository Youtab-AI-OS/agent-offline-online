"""The engine catalogue is private infrastructure and must not be published.

It is a full inventory of provider and model identifiers. While it was served
from the documentation site at ``/docs/api/model-catalog.json``, with a
raw.githubusercontent fallback, anyone could read which engines sit behind the
product by fetching a URL — no credential, no trace, and no way to notice it
had happened.

It now ships inside the distribution. The data is unchanged and the runtime
still needs it; what changed is that reading it requires having the package
rather than knowing an address.

These tests pin the *absence* of the public surface, which is harder to keep
than its presence: a default URL is one convenience commit away from coming
back, and nothing else in the suite would fail if it did.
