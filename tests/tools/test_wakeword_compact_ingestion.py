"""The compact two-speaker ingestion profile in ``import_speaker.py``.

Background
----------
Two of the seven Round 8 speakers record a *compact* sitting rather than the full
recording package: the same directory tree and the same filename grammar, but the
smaller per-section take counts of the governed compact plan
(``recording_assistant.compact_plan``). The profile is registry-gated -- a label
is eligible for the compact layout only because it appears in
``compact_plan.COMPACT_NOISE_ASSIGNMENTS``, never because of a flag or a folder
name -- so it can offer a smaller round to the two compact speakers without ever
weakening the requirements the five full-round speakers are held to.

These tests prove exactly that boundary, positively and negatively, at the seam
``import_speaker`` owns:

* a complete compact package for each compact speaker passes every check and
  resolves to that speaker's fixed role (training / validation), and to nothing
  else;
* a full-round speaker still has only the package layout, and a compact-sized
  tree handed to one is refused on its counts;
* an incomplete compact package -- a delivery shortfall, a dropped near phrase,
  a missing assigned noise source -- is refused, and restoring the take passes;
* the profile cannot be spoofed: the compact layout cannot be *requested* for a
  full-round speaker, a metadata ``speaker_id`` that disagrees with the import
  label cannot move the recording into the other speaker's role (the diagnostic
  form is not authoritative), and asking for the package layout on a compact
  folder selects the stricter layout and then fails its bigger counts -- the flag
  can only tighten, never grant a weaker profile;
* a compact take handed in as mono 24-bit PCM is read and kept as 24-bit; and
* the manual segment-fallback path leaves the seven continuous originals in a
  ``_continuous/`` archive beside the submission, which ingestion never walks,
  never manifests, and never touches.

Conventions this file follows (both from
``tests/tools/test_wakeword_speaker_import.py``, which it reuses):

* Everything is hermetic -- submissions are built under ``tmp_path`` from
  generated tones plus dither, no speech and not one byte of anyone's recording.
* Speaker labels are read out of the registries rather than typed, and directory
  names are assembled from ``import_speaker.SPEAKER_DIR_PREFIX`` plus a label, so
  the human-data commit gate (``test_wakeword_no_human_data_committed.py``) has
  no speaker-keyed record or speaker directory to catch here.
