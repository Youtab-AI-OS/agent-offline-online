"""The level facts of a compressed take, on the format submissions arrive in.

Why this file exists separately
-------------------------------
``import_speaker.py`` reads format facts — container, codec, sample rate,
channels, declared duration — out of the container itself, and that is the one
half of a take's description that needs no decoder. The other half does. Peak,
RMS, DC offset, clipping runs and the noise floor are properties of samples, and
an AAC payload has no samples in it until something decodes it. So on the format
human submissions actually arrive in, ``import_speaker`` is only as good as the
decoder on the machine running it.

Human submissions arrive as ``.m4a``, AAC-LC, 48 kHz, written by phone
voice-memo apps. E001 delivered 6 files at 64 kbps mono; E002 delivered 17 at
128 kbps stereo, twelve of them separately recorded near phrases in their own
subdirectory. Both shapes are built here, in that codec, at those bit rates, and
ingested — because "the tool parses an ISO-BMFF header" and "the tool can
measure clipping on the recording somebody actually handed over" are different
claims, and only the second one is worth anything on the day a drive arrives.

PyAV is that decoder, and it is a pinned dependency of this repository's
``wakeword-ingest`` extra rather than something an operator is expected to have
installed. The first test asserts exactly that, in all three places it has to
agree — the extra, the lock file, and the interpreter running the tests — so a
missing pin is a red test rather than a submission that stalls on the day it
cannot be re-recorded. These tests therefore **fail** where PyAV is absent
instead of skipping: a skip is how an ingestion machine ends up not having it.

The fixture, and why it cannot become evidence
----------------------------------------------
Every audio file here is synthesised in ``tmp_path`` by the test itself — a
shaped tone plus dither, encoded to AAC by the same pinned decoder — and not one
byte of anybody's recording is read. That is enough to exercise decode
mechanics, and it is deliberately barred from being anything else:

* it never exists inside the repository or inside any data root that outlives
  the test, which is asserted rather than assumed (and ``import_speaker``
  refuses a submission inside the repository in the first place);
* every fixture whose name this file is free to choose carries the word
  ``synthetic``, which is a marker in
  ``build_human_dataset.SYNTHETIC_SOURCE_MARKERS``: a manifest that ever cited
  one of these files as a recording is refused by
  ``build_human_dataset.refuse_synthetic_source`` before its bytes are read.
  That refusal is asserted here too, so the bar is a mechanism and not a
  promise;
* the two submission-shaped trees, whose file names the package grammar fixes
  and which therefore cannot carry the marker, carry a written declaration
  instead: their ``RECORDING_METADATA.json`` says in the device fields that the
  tree is a generated fixture and not a recording, so a copy of the folder
  carries its own provenance with it.

Nothing here trains, scores, promotes or writes into ``tools/wakewords/``, and
nothing here reads the two frozen human derivations.
