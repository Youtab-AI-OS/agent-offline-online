"""Pinned wake-word assets must be *installed*, not merely downloaded.

Background
----------
``scripts/wakeword/assets.py`` pinned openWakeWord's melspectrogram and
embedding models by SHA-256 and said, in its own docstring, that this keeps
"the features a model was fit on ... the features it will be scored on". That
was the intent, but nothing ever put those bytes where openWakeWord loads them
from, so the pin was inert. openWakeWord ships no models inside its wheel, so a
clean environment had an empty ``resources/models`` and the first
``AudioFeatures(...)`` died with ``NO_SUCHFILE`` part-way into a multi-hour
pipeline run. The alternative failure is worse and silent: any caller reaching
for ``openwakeword.utils.download_models()`` trains against whatever upstream
published that day rather than against the pinned bytes.

A second input had the same shape of bug. ``generate_speech._load_generator``
opens ``<checkpoint>.json`` beside the VITS checkpoint, and
piper-sample-generator keeps that config inside its git repository instead of
publishing it as a release asset — the mirror of the ``.pt`` release URL
returns 404 — so it could never be fetched and was never installed either.

These tests are hermetic. They build synthetic assets over temporary files and
hash them for real, so the install logic is exercised without the ~2.6 GB of
genuine inputs, which CI does not and should not download.
