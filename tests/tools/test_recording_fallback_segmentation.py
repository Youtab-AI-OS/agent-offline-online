"""Behavioural tests for the manual segment-fallback splitter.

``recording_assistant.segment_fallback`` turns seven hand-made continuous
recordings into the compact plan's 55 canonical takes when the GUI cannot be
used. Everything it decides that a machine can check without a microphone lives
here: the pure silence-based segmenter (right counts, blips dropped, and a
recording without enough silence caught rather than mis-split), the
seven-to-55 mapping staying in sync with the plan, and an end-to-end split on a
temporary ``_continuous/`` folder that writes every canonical file, leaves the
originals byte-for-byte identical, and copies the two continuous sections whole.

All fixtures live under ``tmp_path``; nothing here reads or writes a real
recording, and no per-speaker record is committed. The two compact-plan labels
are bare literals, never in the ``speaker_id = E0nn`` shape the no-human-data
gate forbids in tracked text.
