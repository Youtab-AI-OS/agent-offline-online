"""The recording package has to say what it says, and say the same thing twice.

Background
----------
Two documents and one module describe this round: the speaker-facing package,
the consent record, and ``speaker_recording_spec.py``. The module is the one
machine-readable copy, and ``test_wakeword_speaker_recording_spec.py`` checks it
against ``phrases.py``. This file checks the *documents* against the module, row
for row, and then checks the paragraphs that no data structure can hold.

E002 is why. Three things were missing from that session that no amount of
re-analysis can recover:

* ``okay youtab`` was never recorded. It is the only near phrase that carries
  the real keyword under a *different carrier word*, so it is the one that
  distinguishes a model keyed on the whole phrase from a model keyed on
  "youtab" — and "okay X" is what people say out of habit from other
  assistants.
* ``hey google``, ``hey siri`` and bare ``hey`` were never recorded. All three
  are things an always-on microphone hears constantly, and all three begin
  exactly like the wake word.
* ``hey you tab`` was spoken with a pause between "you" and "tab", in every
  take. That fragments the phrase into two words the detector was never trained
  on, and it left the hardest confusion in the whole inventory — ``hey you
  tab`` (a positive) against ``hey you tap`` (a negative, one voicing feature
  away) — essentially untested.

A document can drift back into that state silently, so the tables are
machine-checked rather than trusted, and the paragraphs a hurried edit trims
first — coverage across five dimensions, the retention policy, the rule about
which pause is allowed — are asserted by name.
