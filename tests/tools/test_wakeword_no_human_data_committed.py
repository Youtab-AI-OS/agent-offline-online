"""Human speech, and everything derived from it, must never enter git.

Background
----------
Qualifying "hey youtab" needs recordings of real people, because every positive
the model has ever seen came from one TTS family. Those recordings are given
for one purpose, on the promise that they stay on local disk — never committed,
never uploaded, never leaving the machine that captured them. The promise
covers more than the ``.m4a`` files: an openWakeWord feature tensor is the
speech resampled into 96 dimensions and is trivially attributable to the person
who spoke it, and a transcript is a verbatim record of what they said.

The failure this guards against is not malice, it is ``git add -A`` after a
recording session. So there are two layers, and they do different jobs:

``.gitignore``
    Stops the accident. It cannot stop ``git add -f``, exactly as the
    infographic rule in that file records after a single ignore pattern was
    sidestepped by a differently spelled directory (#70552).

this gate
    Is what actually enforces the rule. It fails on any *tracked* file whose
    path looks like human audio, a derived tensor or a transcript, and on any
    tracked text whose *content* names a speaker id or a capture root.

The allow-list below is a list of exact paths, not a pattern. A pattern
permitting ``tests/fixtures/wakeword/audio/*.wav`` would also permit a stray
recording dropped into that directory, which is precisely the mistake this is
here to catch. Adding a file to it is a review decision, and the failure
message says so.

Two deliberate limits, recorded rather than papered over:

* Video containers (``.mp4``, ``.webm``, ``.mov``) are **not** in the audio
  inventory. This repository legitimately ships a UI screen recording
  (``website/static/img/docs/.../session-orchestrator-demo.mp4``), and adding
  video suffixes here would mean allow-listing it — which would then also
  allow-list a future screen recording that happened to have someone talking
  over it. If a speaker is ever captured to video, this inventory has to grow
  and that mp4 has to be justified individually.
* The path rules cannot see inside a file. A recording renamed to ``.dat``
  passes them; what catches it is the content scan below and human review of
  any new binary in a diff.
