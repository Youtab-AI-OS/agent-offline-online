"""Consent is out of the wake-word speaker pipeline; the registry is the authority.

Per the Owner's governance mandate, the per-speaker *consent document* is removed
entirely from the technical pipeline. Technical acceptance depends ONLY on audio
properties, labels, role separation, source integrity (checksums) and model
quality -- never on paperwork. Authorization to use a speaker's recordings is a
single, non-identifying, project-level fact: membership of the trusted speaker
registry ``speaker_recording_spec.SPEAKER_ASSIGNMENTS``. No document, signature,
legal name, consent date or consent-file hash may be required, copied, hashed
into evidence, or included in any dataset.

This file proves the rule two ways:

* Regression tests exercise the real validators and importer and show that a
  consent-free submission is GREEN and imports clean; that a missing, partial or
  field-short ``RECORDING_METADATA.json`` is diagnostic and never blocks; that a
  stray ``CONSENT.pdf`` is tolerated and appears nowhere in the outputs; and that
  role separation (E001 training-only, E002 validation-only) is registry-enforced
  and cannot be moved by a caller flag, folder name, filename or manifest.

* Mutation tests re-introduce each removed gate in the source, run a named
  regression target in a fresh subprocess, and assert it turns RED -- then
  restore the byte-exact original and assert it is GREEN again. A mutation that
  survives is a test that was not actually enforcing the rule.

Everything is hermetic: submissions are built under ``tmp_path`` from generated
tones plus dither, no speech and not one byte of anyone's recording.
