"""``validate_speaker_submission.py`` must catch every way a folder can drift
from ``SPEAKER_RECORDING_PACKAGE.md`` before that folder is ingested.

Background
----------
The package tells a speaker that our loader "refuses to guess a label" from an
unrecognised file. Without something that actually enforces that, the first
place a misnamed file or a missing section would be caught is weeks later, once
five speakers' folders are being merged into one training set -- at which point
nobody can ask the speaker what a stray file was supposed to be. Acceptance
depends on audio, naming, structure and checksums; the metadata form is
diagnostic only, and consent is out of the technical pipeline entirely
(authorization is the project-level registry fact, not a document).

The layout under test is the one every speaker in the round uses: three entries
in the speaker folder (``originals/``, ``RECORDING_METADATA.json``,
``SHA256SUMS``) and nothing else.

All fixtures are built under ``tmp_path`` and contain only synthetic
placeholder bytes; nothing here reads or writes a real speaker's recordings,
and the digests in the fixture ``SHA256SUMS`` are genuine digests of those
placeholder bytes rather than invented ones. The fixture's speaker label is
read out of the spec's assignment table rather than written here as a literal,
so this file contains no per-speaker record of its own.
