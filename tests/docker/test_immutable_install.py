"""Runtime smoke tests for Docker immutable install tree and install-method stamp.

Build the real image and verify at runtime:

  1. /opt/youtab is not writable by the youtab user (immutable install tree)
  2. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE and YOUTAB_AGENT_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALLS are set
  3. /opt/youtab/.install_method contains "docker" (code-scoped stamp)
  4. $YOUTAB_AGENT_HOME/.install_method is NOT stamped as "docker" by stage2
  5. A stale "docker" stamp in $YOUTAB_AGENT_HOME is healed (removed) on boot
