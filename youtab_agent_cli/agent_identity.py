"""Public Agent identity for user-facing Runtime surfaces.

A normal user sees ``Alpha v0.6``. The provider and model that serve it are
implementation detail, and this module is the boundary between the two: it
takes the locally configured engine and returns the Agent's public identity,
or nothing.

It is the *only* place that reads the binding half of
``agent_identity.v1.json``. Everything above it — the dashboard, the CLI, any
export — asks for an identity and gets public fields, so a caller cannot leak
the binding by forgetting to strip a field it never received.

``None`` is a meaningful answer. A configured engine that no Agent claims is
not an error and must not be papered over with a guess: a caller renders the
generic product name instead. Inventing an Agent for an unrecognised engine
would put a name on something Youtab never admitted.

The artifact is generated from ``youtab-ai-os``'s governed registry by
``scripts/youtab/generate_agent_identity.py``; it is not maintained here. See
that script for why a second roster in this repository would be a bug.
