"""Truthful terminal results for gateway start, stop and restart.

A spawned child is not a completed operation. The control surface used to
answer ``{"ok": true}`` the instant ``subprocess.Popen`` returned, which is a
claim about the *dispatch* dressed up as a claim about the *outcome*. Every way
the operation can actually fail happens strictly after that moment: the child
exits non-zero, the supervised slot is not registered, the gateway comes down
and does not come back, the whole thing hangs. The dashboard rendered all of
them as success, so the one question an operator asks a lifecycle control --
"did it work?" -- had no truthful answer anywhere in the system.

The contract here is therefore: the POST **accepts** the request and returns
``202`` with a job id, and the job reaches a terminal state only when something
authoritative has been observed. Two things are checked, in order, and both
must agree:

1. **The child's exit status.** Non-zero is a failure and the code is carried
   through to the caller rather than flattened into a boolean.
2. **The gateway's actual liveness**, polled from the same signal
   ``/api/status`` reads. A child that exits ``0`` while leaving no running
   gateway is a *failure* -- this is exactly the shape the two-container
   topology defect had, where ``youtab gateway restart`` returned cleanly
   having restarted nothing the dashboard could see.

Neither check alone is sufficient. Exit status alone trusts a process that may
have done nothing; liveness alone would call a no-op success because something
unrelated was already running.

Bounded, not unbounded
----------------------
Both phases carry deadlines. An operation that never finishes resolves to
``failed``/``timeout`` rather than sitting in ``pending`` forever, because a
control that stays "in progress" indefinitely is the same lie in a slower
voice. The child is deliberately *not* killed on timeout: interrupting a
restart mid-flight is more destructive than reporting honestly that it has not
finished, and the recorded pid lets an operator act.

Nothing here decides *who* may call it. Authorization lives in
:mod:`youtab_agent_cli.authz`; this module assumes the caller already passed it.
