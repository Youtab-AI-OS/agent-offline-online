"""Who may do what, decided server-side and denied by default.

This module replaces a deployment-wide switch that was the wrong shape. The
earlier gate asked "does this deployment offer credential management" and
answered for everybody at once, which meant the only way to give the Owner the
provider catalogue was to give it to every user of the same deployment. The
requirement was never to remove the capability — it was to separate who
reaches it. So the question asked here is "may *this principal* do *this*",
and the answer comes from a role and an explicit scope grant.

Three populations, deliberately not a ladder
--------------------------------------------
A customer Tenant Admin is not a junior Youtab Superadmin. They administer
their own company — its users, its usage, its billing, its audit trail — and
they must never see Youtab's private provider bindings, raw credentials or
internal engine identifiers, because those are not their company's business at
any privilege level. Modelling authority as a single ascending scale would
make "more senior customer" shade into "sees Youtab's infrastructure", which
is exactly the boundary that has to hold. Tenant scope and Youtab-internal
scope are therefore different axes, and a role carries an explicit scope set
rather than "everything below it".

Default-deny, and what that costs
---------------------------------
:data:`ROLE_SCOPES` gives ``NORMAL_USER`` an empty frozenset. A principal that
resolves to no known role is a normal user, and a route with no entry in
:data:`ROUTE_SCOPES` is *not* thereby public — :func:`required_scope` returns
``None`` only for paths deliberately listed as unguarded, and the caller
treats an unmapped guarded prefix as a refusal. The cost is real: a new admin
route is refused until someone maps it. That is the intended failure
direction, because the opposite one ships a surface nobody authorised.

Identity comes from the session, authority comes from the roster
----------------------------------------------------------------
A ``Session`` proves who someone is. It does not say what they may do, and it
must not: the provider that authenticates a user is not the authority on
whether that user is a Youtab Superadmin. Authority is a separate, explicit
grant — the roster — resolved here, server-side, and never taken from a
client-supplied header, query parameter or token claim that the browser could
influence. Until SSO group claims are wired, the roster is the only source.

    #   /api/portal            reports each subscription feature's
    #                          `current_provider`, which is the provider
    #                          binding, alongside Youtab account state.
    #   /api/ssh/ownership     returns `sshOwnerNonce`, a live secret. Its own
    #                          docstring calls it a sensitive endpoint; repo:read
    #                          handed it to every ordinary user.
    # The /api/tools/toolsets/* group, found by sweeping every endpoint the
    # normal-user baseline reaches for bodies that touch provider bindings,
    # credentials or engine identifiers. All four sat at `tool:manage`, which

    #
    #   .../env    PUT persists API keys into ~/.youtab-agent-runtime/.env via
    #              save_env_value -- the same credential store `/api/env` PUT is
    #              held at credential:write for. An allowlist limits *which*
    #              env vars, not the fact that it writes credentials.
    #   .../config GET returns the provider matrix with each provider's env_vars
    #              annotated `is_set` -- the provider catalogue plus exactly the
    #              credential-slot metadata credential:read exists to gate.
    #   .../models GET returns a backend's model catalogue, priced per model.
    #   .../model  PUT persists the engine selection, the same act
    #              `/api/model/set` is held at engine:select for.
    # Redeeming a pairing code. The rest of `/api/pairing` stays
    # `device:manage`, because listing, revoking and clearing all act on other
    # identities. The endpoint itself additionally requires `device:manage`
    # when the caller approves by request id rather than by code -- the
    # authorization layer matches on path and method and cannot see which
    # branch a body selects, so that half of the decision has to live in the
    # handler.

    # `config.yaml` is where the engine bindings live -- `model.default`,
    # `model.provider`, `mcp_servers` and the custom endpoint base URLs -- so
    # `GET .../raw` hands a normal user the same private catalogue
    # `/api/model/options` is held at `provider:read` for, plus the file's
    # absolute host path.
    #
    # `PUT .../raw` is worse and is the widest bypass found on this surface:
    # it is a full-document replacement (`merge_existing=False`), so a caller
    # who can write it can set `model.provider` directly and defeat
    # `engine:select`, `provider:write` and the custom-endpoint controls in one
    # request, without ever touching the routes those scopes guard.
    #
    # `/api/config/defaults` and `/api/config/schema` stay public: they are the
