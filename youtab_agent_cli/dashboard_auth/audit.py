"""Audit log for dashboard-auth events.

Profile-aware location: ``$YOUTAB_AGENT_HOME/logs/dashboard-auth.log``.
Format: one JSON object per line. Token-like fields are stripped before
serialisation to avoid leaking refresh tokens or JWTs to disk.

This module deliberately keeps a minimal dependency surface — no imports
from ``youtab_constants`` or other youtab_agent_cli modules — so it can be
imported safely from middleware code that loads early in the startup
sequence.
